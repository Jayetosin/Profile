 <p> After I graduated from school and was about going for service that was when the pandanmic iissue began<br> 
    and i had not registered to serve my fathers and at that time so during that period i decided not to <br>
    stay idle so I learnt Taioring during that period,I was able to sew before the year ended<br>
    (but not perfectly though).Before i Knew what was going on it was already a new year so I got a teaching<br>
    Job(because i can't stay broke na, I need to earn money). So I got a teaching Job and Not long after<br> 
    I started teaching,and i registered for Nysc then not long after that I went for service and i served<br>
    in Nasarawa state, I served at Lizdav Academy which was a private school and I had to be at school<br> 
    everyday except my CDS days and I was very active in my CDS. During my Nysc i did a course in Digital<br>
    Marketing and also Office Management.I wrote my Exams and i passed it, I finished serving my fathers land<br> 
    in April 2022. 
    <p> I decided to go back to the school I was teaching before I went for My service and i was employed,<br> 
       But I know that was not what I wanted to do, So a friend of mine asked me if i was interested in <br>
       earning Tech and sure I was interested and I decided to go for it so it will be extra qulification in<br> 
       My C.V and too keep Myself busy while searching for a better place of work. I enrolled in<br>

       found out that it was very interesting and slowly i was strivng to Learn more and while coding if <br>
