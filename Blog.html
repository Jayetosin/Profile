    <p class="container2">Since I started this Tech Journey I realised that when you are consistent in doing<br>
        something you become better and you learn different ways of doing it,and also be determined<br>
        to get better and be opened minded to learn new things. Even when feel thingd are not going as <br>
        planned,you have to keep trying. Thomas Eddison who invent the light Bulb tried it 99times before <br>
        he was able to invent the first light bulb, that was because despites the times he failed he kept <br>
        trying Oscar Widle once said
