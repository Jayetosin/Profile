     <p>My journey in tech has not being very easy i have to do many things in a day and <br>
     still create time to attend class,practice alone,do assignments and also help collegues<br>
     attending the same class with me do assignments when they don't understand whie using W3school<br>
     and google to solve difficult situation while coding and sometimes I watch videos on youtube especially<br>
     when I was having difficulty pushing codes to Github and later while trying to use Netlify<br>
     In everything I give thanks to GOD for the strength and I'm determined to be among the best         </p>
